# GitHub Actions CI/CD Workflow for Node.js Todo List API
# 
# This workflow automatically runs on every push and pull request
# 
# What it does:
# 1. Checks out your code
# 2. Sets up Node.js environment
# 3. Installs dependencies (npm ci)
# 4. Runs all tests (npm test)
# 5. Shows a green checkmark ✅ if tests pass
#
# QA Impact: Demonstrates continuous integration and automated testing
# Resume Value: Shows you understand CI/CD, automated testing, and code quality
# Siemens JD Match: "Running test cases" and "process stability"

name: Node.js CI/CD Pipeline

# Trigger this workflow on push and pull requests to main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]

# Environment variables available to all jobs
env:
  NODE_ENV: test

jobs:
  # Job: Test Suite
  # Purpose: Install dependencies and run automated tests
  test:
    name: Run Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # Test across multiple Node.js versions (demonstrates QA mindset of compatibility testing)
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x]
    
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      - name: Checkout repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Full history for better analysis
      
      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Set up Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm'  # Cache npm dependencies for faster builds
      
      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      # npm ci (clean install) is preferred over npm install in CI/CD
      # Reason: ci installs exact versions from package-lock.json (reproducible builds)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        env:
          NODE_ENV: test
      
      # Step 4: Run test suite
      # QA Practice: Automated test execution ensures code quality on every commit
      - name: Run test suite
        run: npm test -- --coverage --passWithNoTests
        env:
          NODE_ENV: test

          JWT_SECRET: 'test-secret-key'
          PORT: 3001
      
      # Step 5: Upload test coverage reports (optional enhancement)
      # This could be integrated with services like Codecov for coverage tracking
      - name: Test Results Summary
        if: always()  # Run even if tests fail
        run: echo "✅ Test execution completed. Check logs above for results."

  # Job: Code Quality Checks (Optional)
  # Purpose: Lint and validate code style
  lint:
